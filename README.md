## About Me
Hi, I'm Alston! I'm a rising college Junior currently residing in the United States.

## Interests
Neural Network Simulators: I have a keen interest in simulating spiking neural networks (SNNs) using tools like Nengo, BindsNET, GenericsSNN, SuperNeuro, and EvtSNN.

Complex Datasets: Working with datasets like Coco and ImageNet to explore broader applications of SNNs.

Software Development: I enjoy contributing to impactful projects. One of my notable projects is Starving Mammoth, an app designed to reduce food waste on campus.

Hardware Design and Simulations: I frequently deal with configuration settings related to hardware design and simulations.

## Projects
Starving Mammoth: An app to reduce food waste on campus by allowing students to share the locations of leftover food from events. I contributed significantly to the backend development using Java.

Other Projects: Check out my repositories to see more of my work in software development, neural networks, and simulations.
