## About Me
Hi, I'm Alston! I'm a rising college Junior currently residing in the United States.

## Interests
# Neural Network Simulators: 

I have a keen interest in simulating spiking neural networks (SNNs) using tools like Nengo, BindsNET, GenericsSNN, SuperNeuro, and EvtSNN.

# Computer Hardware/Architecture Simulators:

I enjoy working with processing in memory simulators that model power, area, timing, etc. 

# Software Development: 

I enjoy contributing to impactful projects. One of my notable projects is Starving Mammoth, an app designed to reduce food waste on campus.

# Hardware Design and Simulations: 

I frequently deal with configuration settings related to hardware design and simulations.

## Projects

# Starving Mammoth: 

An app to reduce food waste on campus by allowing students to share the locations of leftover food from events. I contributed significantly to the backend development using Java.

# Other Projects: 

Check out my repositories to see more of my work in software development, neural networks, and simulations.

# Current Project:

I'm currently in a research program working with various PiM simulators and looking to create a framework for creating such simulators. Hopefully, I will be able to create my own simulator by the end the of the Summer!
