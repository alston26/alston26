## About Me
Hi, I'm Alston! I'm a college Junior currently residing in the United States.

## Interests
### Neural Network Simulators: 

I am keenly interested in simulating spiking neural networks (SNNs) using tools like Nengo, BindsNET, GenericsSNN, SuperNeuro, and EvtSNN.

### Computer Hardware/Architecture Simulators:

I enjoy working with processing in memory simulators that model power, area, timing, etc. 

### Software Development: 

I enjoy contributing to impactful projects. One of my notable projects is Starving Mammoth, an app designed to reduce food waste on campus.

### Hardware Design and Simulations: 

I frequently deal with configuration settings related to hardware design and simulations.

## Projects

### Starving Mammoth: 

An app to reduce food waste on campus by allowing students to share the locations of leftover food from events. I contributed significantly to the backend development using Java.

### Amherst Lost & Found

An app that serves as a central hub for lost and founds at Amherst College. The app also leverages torchvision image recognition to allow for ease of use. We used Django backend and html, jss, and css frontend.[here](https://github.com/Tetsuya787/LostandFound)

### Other Projects: 

Please browse my repositories for more of my work in software development, neural networks, and simulations.

### Current Projects:

I'm currently working on building my personal website and adding interactive elements. The code for that is also in my repository [here](https://github.com/alston26/Personal-Website)

I'm also learning how to parallelize programs with OpenMP and Nvidia CUDA.
